            <h4>Engineering Student</h4>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is <b>Mithun</b>, and I am an aspiring Full Stack Developer with a passion 
                for creating seamless and dynamic web applications. Currently, I am honing my skills in 
                both front-end and back-end development, eager to bring innovative ideas to life through code.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am pursuing a B.Tech in Information Technology at Chennai Institute of Technology, Chennai. 
                My coursework has provided a strong foundation in computer science principles, software 
                development, and web technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am driven by curiosity to understand how things work and a desire to build applications 
                that solve real-world problems. Full Stack Development excites me because it allows me to work 
                on all aspects of the development process, from designing responsive user interfaces to 
                ensuring robust back-end functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me playing <b>cricket</b>, which helps me stay balanced and 
                inspired. I am also an avid learner, always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities 
                to grow both personally and professionally.
            </p>
