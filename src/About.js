          Hello! My name is <b className="text-cyan-300">Mithun</b>, and I am an aspiring <b>Full Stack Developer</b> with a passion 
          for creating seamless and dynamic web applications. I'm currently honing my skills in 
          both front-end and back-end development, eager to bring innovative ideas to life through code.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am pursuing a B.Tech in Information Technology at <b>Chennai Institute of Technology</b>, Chennai. 
          My coursework has provided a strong foundation in computer science principles, software 
          development, and modern web technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm driven by curiosity and a desire to build applications that solve real-world problems. 
          Full Stack Development excites me because it allows me to contribute across the entire development stack â€” 
          from designing responsive user interfaces to building robust backend systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of coding, I enjoy playing <b className="text-cyan-300">cricket</b>, which helps me stay balanced and inspired. 
          I'm also an avid learner, always exploring new challenges and opportunities to grow both personally and professionally.
